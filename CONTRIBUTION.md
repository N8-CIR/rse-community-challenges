# Contribution Guidelines

Please follow the guidelines below when contributing to this directory.

## General guidelines

- Where possible link out to a wider discussion on a topic rather than copying content into this directory.
- Consult the community before adding a new challenge to ensure it is relevant and not already covered. This can be done via the [RSE Slack](https://society-rse.org/about/join/) or through discussions at events.
- Keep the content up-to-date. If you see something that is out-of-date, please update it or raise an issue.

## Adding a new challenge

To add a new challenge, create a new markdown file in the `rse-community-challenges` directory. The file should be named after the challenge, with words separated by hyphens. For example, if the challenge is "Inclusivity and Diversity", the file should be named `inclusivity-and-diversity.md`.
Copy the content from `_template.md` into the new file and fill in the details for the challenge.

## Challenge page structure

See docs/\_page_spec.md for the structure of a challenge page.
