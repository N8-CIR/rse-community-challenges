### Work life balance

RSEs often work long hours and may find it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. This can lead to burnout and other health issues.

### Working on the things we love

Often we are working on projects that are defined by others, and we may not have the opportunity to work on the things we are passionate about. This can lead to a lack of motivation and job satisfaction.
