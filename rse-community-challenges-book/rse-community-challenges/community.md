# Community

Community is key to the success of the RSE profession. It is important to have a strong community to support each other, share knowledge and best practices, and advocate for the profession. However, building and maintaining a strong community can be challenging. This challenge is about identifying the key issues that the RSE community faces and developing strategies to overcome them.

## Evidence of the problem

## Guidance

## Sub Problems

- **Knowledge Sharing** - The challenge of knowledge sharing is a common problem faced by RSEs. RSEs often work in isolation and do not have the opportunity to share their knowledge with others. This can lead to duplication of effort, inefficiency, and missed opportunities for collaboration. RSEs need to find ways to share their knowledge with others and collaborate with their peers to improve the quality of their work.
