# Green RSE

The environmental impact of RSEs through their work is a growing concern. RSEs need to consider the environmental impact of their work and adopt sustainable practices where possible.

## Evidence of the problem

## Impact Targets

### Reduce the environmental impact of RSEs through their work

This impact target will be achieved by creating a set of best practices for RSEs to follow in order to reduce their environmental impact. This will be achieved by creating a Green RSE SIG.

```yaml
id: 1
```

### Raise awareness of the environmental impact of RSEs and the importance of adopting sustainable practices

```yaml
id: 2
```
