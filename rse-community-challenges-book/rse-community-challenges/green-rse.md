# Green RSE

The environmental impact of RSEs through their work is a growing concern. RSEs
need to consider the environmental impact of their work and adopt sustainable
practices where possible.

## Evidence of the problem

## Impact Targets

### Reduce the environmental impact of RSEs through their work

This impact target will be achieved by creating a set of best practices for RSEs
to follow in order to reduce their environmental impact. This will be achieved by
creating a Green RSE SIG.

```yaml
id: 1
```

### Raise awareness of the environmental impact of RSEs

Raise awareness of the environmental impact of RSEs and the importance of adopting
sustainable practices

```yaml
id: 2
```

## Objectives

### Develop a set of best practices for RSEs to reduce their environmental impact

This objective will be achieved by creating a set of best practices for RSEs to
follow in order to reduce their environmental impact. This will be achieved by
creating a Green RSE SIG.

```yaml
id: 1
Impact targets: [1]
```

### Encourage green rse champions within RSE groups to promote sustainable practices

```yaml
id: 2
Impact targets: [1, 2]
```

### Improve transparency of RSE impact on the environment

```yaml
id: 3
Impact targets: [2]
```

### Adequate training and resources for RSEs to adopt sustainable practices

```yaml
id: 4
Impact targets: [1, 2]
```

## Actions

### Create a Green RSE SIG

This action will be achieved by creating a Green RSE SIG.
Some more text

```yaml
id: 1
```

#### Outputs

- An SIG dedicated to the green RSE initiative `objectives: [1]`
- A person to lead the Green RSE SIG `objectives: [1,2]`

### Life cycle assessment

We will develop a life cycle assessment tool for RSEs to use to assess the
environmental impact of their work.

```yaml
id: 2
```

#### Outputs

- A tool that calculates the life cycle impact of your work `objectives: [3]`

### Create training materials and resources for RSEs to adopt sustainable practices

We will create training materials and resources for RSEs to adopt sustainable
practices.

```yaml
id: 3
```

#### Outputs

- Training materials and resources for RSEs to adopt sustainable practices
  `objectives: [4]`
