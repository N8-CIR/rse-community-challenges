# Best Practice Software Development

RSEs may struggle to implement best practices in software development, due to a
lack of training or experience in this area. This can lead to issues with code
quality, maintainability, and scalability. This is a particular challenge when
working with researchers who may not have a background in software development.

## Evidence of the problem

## Impact Targets

### Research software is of a high quality, maintainable, and scalable

Research software is of a high quality, maintainable, and scalable. This will
ensure that it achieves long term societal impact.

```yaml
id: 1
```

### Research software results are reproducible or replicable

Research software results are reproducible or replicable. This will ensure that
research findings can be trusted and built upon.

```yaml
id: 2
```

## Objectives

### Understand the scale of the problem of best practices in research software development

This objective will result in a better understanding of the scale of the problem
of best practices in research software development.

```yaml
id: 1
Impact targets: [1,2]
```

### RSEs have the skills, knowledge and resources to implement best practices

This objective will result in RSEs having the skills, knowledge and resources to
implement best practices in research software development.

```yaml
id: 1
Impact targets: [1,2]
```

### Best practice is shared and adopted across the RSE community

This objective will result in best practice being shared and adopted across the
RSE community.

```yaml
id: 1
Impact targets: [1,2]
```

## Actions

### Establish RSE champions in key areas of software best practice

Identify RSE champions in key areas of software best practice, who can lead the
community in adopting best practices.

```yaml
id: 1
```

#### Outputs

- RSEs with the skills, knowleddge and resources to lead the community
  `objectives: [1,2]`

## Current Active Projects and Initiatives

- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) - The Carpentries is a community of
  instructors teaching software development and data science skills to researchers.
  They offer workshops on topics such as version control, programming, and data management.
- [Champions for Change](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/episodes/16017272-en-champions-for-change-in-research-imperial-college-london-and-cambridge-university)
  Code for thought podcast on the Champions for Change initiative at Imperial
  College London and Cambridge University.
- [European Virtual Institute for Research Software Excellence](https://everse.software/)
  The EVERSE project aims to create a framework for research software and code
  excellence, collaboratively designed and championed by the research communities,
  in pursuit of building a European network of Research Software Quality and setting
  the foundations of a future Virtual Institute for Research Software Excellence.
- [RSQ kit](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit) - A collection of
  curated training resources, tools and guidelines on research software quality
- [UoY Research Coding Course](https://researchcodingclub.github.io/course/) -
  A course developed by the University of York Research Coding Club to teach best
  practices in research software development.

## Past work towards overcoming the challenge

- [Introducing the FAIR Principles for research software](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x)
A paper introducing the FAIR principles for research software.
