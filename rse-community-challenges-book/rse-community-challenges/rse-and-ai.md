# RSE and AI

With AI having a growing impact on both research and software development, RSEs
are increasingly required to understand and work with AI technologies.

## Evidence of the problem

[Is AI After My Job? Navigating the Future of Research Software Engineering](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/ai-after-my-job-navigating-future-research-software-engineering?mc_cid=b6f51398dd)

## Impact Targets

### RSEs are proficient in AI technologies relevant to their work

This impact target will be achieved by providing RSEs with the necessary skills
and knowledge to effectively work with AI technologies.

```yaml
id: 1
```

### RSEs are able to respond to the use of AI by researchers

AI is increasingly used to produce research software. RSEs need to be ready to respond
to the benefits and challenges associated with this.

```yaml
id: 1
```

## Objectives

### Key AI skills and knowledge for RSEs identified and documented

This objective will be achieved by identifying and documenting the key AI skills
and knowledge that RSEs need to effectively work with AI technologies.
The output document should be agreed upon by key stakeholders in the RSE
community.

```yaml
id: 1
Impact targets: [1]
```

## Actions

### Conduct a survey of RSEs to identify current AI skills and knowledge

This action will be achieved by conducting a survey of RSEs to identify their
current AI skills and knowledge.

```yaml
id: 1
status: not-started
```

#### Outputs

- A report summarising the survey results `objectives: [1]`
- A list of key AI skills and knowledge for RSEs `objectives: [1]`

## Current Active Projects and Initiatives

- [Direct Framework](https://directframework.com/)
  A project to define the competencies required for RSEs at different levels of
  experience, and to provide guidance on how to develop these competencies.
