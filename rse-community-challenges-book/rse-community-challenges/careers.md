# Careers

RSEs may find it difficult to progress in their careers, as the role of RSE is not always well-defined within academic institutions. This can make it difficult for RSEs to advance to more senior positions or plan for their future career development.

## Evidence of the problem

## Guidance

One of the best ways to understand your own RSE path and its next steps is by talking with—and especially, listening to—a range of developers and researchers, and reflecting on how you might apply what you learn from their career path and work experiences [Research Software Engineers: Creating a Career Path—and a Career](https://zenodo.org/records/10073233).

## Sub Problems

These are issues that could be becode challenges in their own right, but are also part of the larger challenge of career progression for RSEs.

- **Competative Salary** - RSEs may find it difficult to secure a competitive salary, as the role of RSE is not always well-recognised within academic institutions. This can make it difficult for RSE leaders to attract and retain talent
