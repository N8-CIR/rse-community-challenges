# Careers

RSEs may find it difficult to progress in their careers, as the role of RSE is not always well-defined within academic institutions. This can make it difficult for RSEs to advance to more senior positions or plan for their future career development.

## Evidence of the problem

## Impact Targets

### RSEs feel they are in a role that reflects their experience and expertise

This impact target will be achieved by creating roles that match the ambitions and interests of RSEs.

```yaml
id: 1
```

### RSEs feel they are renumerated fairly for their work

This impact target will be achieved by ensuring that RSEs are paid a competitive salary for their work.

```yaml
id: 2
```

## Objectives

### A clear implementation of an RSE career path

This objective will be achieved by evidencing a clear career path from entry level to senior RSE and examples of it being implemented from start to finish.

```yaml
id: 1
Impact targets: [1]
```

## Actions

### Share examples of career paths for RSEs

This action will be achieved by sharing examples of career paths for RSEs.

```yaml
id: 1
```

#### Outputs

- Improve availability of career paths to RSEs `objectives: [1]`


## Current Active Projects and Initiatives

- [RSE Competencies Toolkit](https://github.com/RSEToolkit/rse-competencies-toolkit/issues) - A project to define the competencies required for RSEs at different levels of experience, and to provide guidance on how to develop these competencies.

## Guidance

One of the best ways to understand your own RSE path and its next steps is by talking with—and especially, listening to—a range of developers and researchers, and reflecting on how you might apply what you learn from their career path and work experiences [Research Software Engineers: Creating a Career Path—and a Career](https://zenodo.org/records/10073233).

## Sub Problems

These are issues that could be becode challenges in their own right, but are also part of the larger challenge of career progression for RSEs.

- **Competative Salary** - RSEs may find it difficult to secure a competitive salary, as the role of RSE is not always well-recognised within academic institutions. This can make it difficult for RSE leaders to attract and retain talent
