# Careers

RSEs may find it difficult to progress in their careers, as the role of RSE is
not always well-defined within academic institutions. This can make it difficult
for RSEs to advance to more senior positions or plan for their future career development.

## Evidence of the problem

- [SSI A not-so-brief history of Research Software Engineers](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0)
- [Why it’s so difficult to define an RSE career path CW 24](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/why-its-so-difficult-define-rse-career-path)
- [Identifying the Foundational Competencies of a Research Software Engineer](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/identifying-foundational-competencies-research-software-engineer)

## Impact Targets

### RSEs feel they are in a role that reflects their experience and expertise

This impact target will be achieved by creating roles that match the ambitions and
interests of RSEs.

```yaml
id: 1
```

### RSEs feel they are renumerated fairly for their work

This impact target will be achieved by ensuring that RSEs are paid a competitive
salary for their work.

```yaml
id: 2
```

## Objectives

### A clear implementation of an RSE career path

This objective will be achieved by evidencing a clear career path from entry level
to senior RSE and examples of it being implemented from start to finish.

```yaml
id: 1
Impact targets: [1]
```

## Actions

### Share examples of career paths for RSEs

This action will be achieved by sharing examples of career paths for RSEs.

```yaml
id: 1
```

#### Outputs

- Improve availability of career paths to RSEs `objectives: [1]`

## Current Active Projects and Initiatives

- [Direct Framework](https://directframework.com/)
  A project to define the competencies required for RSEs at different levels of
  experience, and to provide guidance on how to develop these competencies.
- [Step Up](https://step-up.ac.uk/) A Strategic TEchnical Platform for University
  Technical Professionals. Supporting "digital Research Technical Professionals"
  (dRTPs) and researchers working with research software, research data and research
  computing infrastructure, in the London region and beyond.

## Guidance

One of the best ways to understand your own RSE path and its next steps is by talking
with—and especially, listening to—a range of developers and researchers, and
reflecting on how you might apply what you learn from their career path and work
experiences [Research Software Engineers: Creating a Career Path—and a Career](https://zenodo.org/records/10073233).

## Sub Problems

These are issues that could be becode challenges in their own right, but are also
part of the larger challenge of career progression for RSEs.

- **Competative Salary** - RSEs may find it difficult to secure a competitive
  salary, as the role of RSE is not always well-recognised within academic institutions.
  This can make it difficult for RSE leaders to attract and retain talent
