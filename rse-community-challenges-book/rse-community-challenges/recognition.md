# Recognition

RSEs often struggle to get recognition for their work. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the role of RSEs, or a lack of visibility of their contributions. RSEs may also find it difficult to get credit for their work, as they are often not listed as authors on academic papers.

There needs to be recognition of the different kinds of roles that RSEs play in research, and the importance of their work in enabling research to be carried out. RSEs should be recognised as key contributors to research, and their work should be valued and rewarded accordingly.
